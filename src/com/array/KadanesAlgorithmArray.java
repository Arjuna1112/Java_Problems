/*
* Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm can be viewed both as a greedy and DP. As we can see that we are keeping a running sum of integers
*  and when it becomes less than 0, we reset it to 0 (Greedy Part). This is because continuing with a negative sum is way
*  more worse than restarting with a new range. Now it can also be viewed as a DP, at each stage we have 2 choices:
* Either take the current element and continue with previous sum OR restart a new range. These both choices are
* being taken care of in the implementation.
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Auxiliary Space: O(1)
