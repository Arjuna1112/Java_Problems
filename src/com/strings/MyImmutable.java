This is one of the most simple way of creating immutable class in Java, where all fields of class also remains immutable like 
String in above case*/

/*In above example of creating immutable class, Date is a mutable object. If getRemindingDate() returns actual Date object than 
despite remindingDate being final variable, internals of Date can be modified by client code. By returning clone() or copy of 
remindingDate, we avoid that danger and preserves immutability of class*/
